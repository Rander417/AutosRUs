### PART I MPG Regression

The results show that vehicle weight provides a non-random variance amount. Length, weight, and ground clearance do not add a significant amount.

The p-value of the analysis is 5.35e-11 which is much smaller that the default .05% significant level. We can therefore reject the null hypothesis. This also means that the slope of the linear model is not zero

The r-squared value is .71 which means that this accurately predicts the mpg roughly 70% of the time. While this is positive, a higher value would provide more confidence in this use case. Cars are complicated machines and MPG is a critical metric. A higher level of accuracy should be pursued.


### PART II Suspension Coil Summary

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? Why or why not?
The summary table shows that Lot1 and Lot2 are safely within the 100 pounds per inch limit. However Lot3 has a variance of more that double the limit at 220. A review into Lot3 should take place to determine the cause of the variance.


### PART III Suspension Coil T-Test

The p-value of the t-test is .51. Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and we would state that the two means are statistically similar.

The mean of the Mecha sample is not significantly differnt from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per inch


## Part IV Design Your Own Study
Most of a new study would focus on comparing the Mecha cars to direct competitors from other companies and also comparisons to traditional vehicles. With the goal of showing the increased value of the Mecha cars or at the very least revealing to AutosRUs the deficiencies in MechaCars that need to be worked on.

One test we could perform would be a chi squared tests to determine if there is a statistical difference accident frequency and maintenance costs between traditional vehicles and Mecha type vehicles.
Example hypothesis statements
H0 : There is no difference in accident rates between both groups
Ha : There is a difference in accident rates between both groups

Data that custmors may be interested in and used in testing
- Purchase costs
- Maintenance costs
- Accident frequencies
- Crash test results
- fuel efficiency (mpg). Essential metric that customers will need as part of their buying decision due to the ongoing cost of gas.
- Fuel type
- Color options. Aesthetic preference
- Manufacture year
- Transmission type. Most will prefer automoatic but there is a market for manuals.
- Ground clearance. Depending on a customer's driving environment they may want a higher clearance
- Weight. Impacts handling
- Length. Impacts parking
